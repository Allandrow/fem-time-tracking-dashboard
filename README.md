## My process

The main goal was to develop in a component driven fashion using Storybook. The ability to create and visualize components in isolation allowed me to concentrate on each part individualy before merging all in a single layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### Continued development

Main aspects to keep working on are :

- CSS Grid
- Customization of Storybook stories
